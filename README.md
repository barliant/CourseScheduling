# Course Scheduling

## Schedule

### 2017 Winter Quarter
During winter quarter, I will implement the algorithm and resolve dificulties described. I
will also have a working application done by the end of this quarter.
- **Week 1:** Find a method to represent the study plan graph.

- **Week 2:** Apply the basic Coffman-Graham algorithm, which defines a fixed width bound $ W $, and test its performance in this particular course scheduling problem assuming that the number of classes a student takes will not exceed a fixed width bound.

- **week 3:** Collect courses information online by using web crawlers or a UCI-Course-API on GitHub. 

- **Week 4, 5, 6:** Modify the algorithm to solve difficulties illustrated and test the quality of the final algorithm.

- **week 7, 8, 9, 10:** Implement the algorithm by using collected data. May make a simple working command-line interface first, and if time permits, develop a web-based application.

### 2017 Spring Quarter

During spring quarter, I will focus on writing and revising the project report. 

- **Week 1:** An outline of the project report.

- **Week 2:** First 1/3 of the project report.

- **Week 3:** Second 1/3 of the project report.

- **Week 4:** Third 1/3 of the project report.

- **Week 5, 6:** Second draft of the project report.

- **Week 7, 8:** Third draft of the project report.

- **Week 9:**  Forth draft of the project report. 

- **Week 10:** Final draft of the project report.
